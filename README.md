# Segmentation-Analysis-on-German-Credit-data-classification-

Project description: segment credit card customers into different risk profiles using xgboost technique 

• Translate the missing values in the dataset using drop, replace and getdummie functions to set missing data to zero for 
simple visualisation in xgboost tree later 
• Split the data into training and testing datasets using stratification, setting categorical data to binary values using one-hot 
encoding method to tailor the customer profile neatly 
• Optimize the parameters using cross validation and interpret the optimized xgboost model to increase the accuracy for the 
testing data prediction
